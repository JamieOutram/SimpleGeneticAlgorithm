Simple Evolutionary Genetic Algorithm with mutation and natural selection

Starting from a population of random strings, 
uses random mutations and natural selection to match the target string.
 
For each new child, Two parents are selected at random and compete to reproduce.
The winning parent creates a mutated copy of itself as a child for the next generation.

Individuals are scored according to how many of their letters match the target string.
